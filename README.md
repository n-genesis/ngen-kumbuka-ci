to your `app` folder. The affected files can be copied or merged from `vendor/codeigniter4/framework/app`.


## **Need to update setup steps**

## Server Requirements

PHP version 8.5 or higher is required, with the following extensions installed:
- [intl](http://php.net/manual/en/intl.requirements.php)
- [mbstring](http://php.net/manual/en/mbstring.installation.php)

Additionally, make sure that the following extensions are enabled in your PHP:

- json (enabled by default - don't turn it off)
- [mysqlnd](http://php.net/manual/en/mysqlnd.install.php) if you plan to use MySQL
- [libcurl](http://php.net/manual/en/curl.requirements.php) if you plan to use the HTTP\CURLRequest library

### Setup Localhost
1. Download or clone the repo to your `localhost` folder.
2. Change directory to `cd ngen-kumbuka-ci` folder.
3. Import `ngen-bootsnippets-ci/database.sql` to your MySQL or MariaDB Server, create a user and grant all rights to the imported `DB`
4. Rename `env` to `.env`
5. (Optional) Change the App URL to `app.baseURL = 'http://localhost/ngen-kumbuka-ci/public/'` if nedded.
6. Update database config, change the lines where `database.default.database =`, `database.default.username =`, `database.default.password =`, and `database.default.hostname =` in .env file to match your database credentials.
7. Run the Migrates: `php spark migrate --all`.
8. Launch the development server (Two options)
    1. Run `php spark serve` to launch a built-in development server.
    2. Or if using VS Code Tasks
        1. **Open the Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS).
        2. **Type "run task"**: Start typing `Tasks: Run Task` into the search bar and select it from the dropdown list.
        3. **Select the task**: A list of available tasks (auto-detected or those defined in your tasks.json file) will appear. Select `Run Compser Server (Kubmuka)` to the launch a built-in development server the integrated terminal.
9. Alternatively, you can browse the app using a web browser, by entering this URL address `http://localhost:8080` or the App URL used in `app.baseURL`.
